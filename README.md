## Before you start

Allure Report 3.0 is still in active development and this is the first public version, 
and this is far from everything we plan to launch.

We're following high quality standards, but some features may be changed or removed in 
the release version.

## Installation

Use your favorite package manager to install Allure Report:

```shell
npm add allure
yarn add allure
pnpm add allure
```

## Usage

Allure Report utilizes an `allurerc.js` runtime configuration file which provides an 
ability to customize your workflow.

```js
import { defineConfig } from "allure";

export default defineConfig({
  name: "Allure Report",
  output: "./allure-report",
  historyPath: "./history.jsonl",
  plugins: {
    "allure-awesome": {
      options: {
        reportName: "HelloWorld",
        singleFile: true,
        reportLanguage: "en",
        open: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## Plugins

You can combine multiple plugins in your configuration file at once.

Every plugin has its own set of options, consult the documentation for more details.
